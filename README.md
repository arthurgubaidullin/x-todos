# X-ToDos

## Overview

**X-ToDos** is a browser-based To-Do application intended as an experiment for using Rust to build high-level services and logic for frontend apps.

## Status

Experimental. Not production-ready.

## Hypothesis

I expect that using Rust will simplify client-server serialization/deserialization, and improve business logic management on the client side.
